          <h2>EQ vs IQ</h2>
          <p>
            We all know about IQ. It's based on logic and how good you are at
            solving abstract problems. IQ is static - your level of intelligence
            is determined at birth. IQ is an old concept of what intelligence
            is. Researchers interested in how our minds work felt that IQ wasn't
            sufficient by itself to analyse how intelligent a person is and they
            started to look at other types of intelligence, one of these being
            emotional intelligence (EQ).
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence looks at how well you understand yourself
            (your strengths and weaknesses, how you react emotionally in
            difficult situations) and how well you understand other people. EQ
            is seen as neuroplastic - we can improve it with practice, it's not
            set at birth.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
          <p>
            EQ is important because it is interpersonal. We don't work in a
            bubble. We have to be aware of how other people are feeling and how
            we're feeling, so that we can change our behaviour when it's
            negative or unproductive and so that we can relate to the people we
            work with. If we want to take on a leadership role, we will need to
            understand and be able to relate well to the people that we are
            leading. EQ also helps us deal with challenges in life. Life is not
            predictable or easy.

          <h2>If EQ is changable, how can we improve it?</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Changing our brain patterns with meditation.</strong> The
              point of meditation is to be in the present. If you train your
              brain to be in the present, you'll be able to recognise your
              emotions as they happen and be able to practice active listening
              to others (not thinking about other things while someone else is
              talking).
            </li>

              <strong
                >Recognising our emotions by paying attention to how our bodies
                feel (our physiological reactions) and by stopping for a moment
                before reacting.</strong
              >
              When I get anxious, my hands get sweaty and my shoulders stiffen.
              It can be easier to notice these traits than the emotion itself.
              Once I've recognised the emotion, once I know what's going on, I
              can take a moment to breathe and try to understand why it's
              happening.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Understanding ourselves and our emotions.</strong> If I
              have the same kind of emotional response to a particular trigger,
              and I can recognise that trigger before reacting, I can try to
              change my behaviour. For example, if I know that if I get
              overstimulated because I'm trying to concentrate on a task and
              someone is talking to me at the same time, I can get irrationally
              irritated. When I feel myself getting frustrated, I can take a
              step back before I react out of anger and snap at someone. I can
              then narrow down my focus and ask that person to wait until I
              finish my task or thought process, or stop what I'm doing to
              listen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Understanding other people.</strong> Actively listening to
              other people can help us understand where someone else is coming
              from. If we are quiet when someone else is talking and don't
              interject, if we concentrate on being in the moment and listening
              rather than thinking about what we want for lunch, we don't direct
              the conversation but instead let the person explain themselves
              completely. When we repeat back what we think we heard, they can
              either feel understood or correct us if we've missed something.
