          <h3><em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the 
            Human Skills learning?</em></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>I am prudent. I knew I was cautious and often felt bad about myself for overthinking 
              things, but I have found I am also prudent, which is connected. I like to think through 
              things before I do them. I don’t like to make rushed decisions. I like to step back and 
              look at a problem before attempting it. 
            </li>
            <li>I like to do things well, so that I feel I have accomplished something. This makes me 
              work hard and helps with motivation. 
            </li>
            <li>
              I procrastinate because I’m afraid that I won’t be able to do something. I have learnt I
              can stop procrastinating by facing my fear, or looking at what I’m afraid of. If I tell
              myself the code doesn’t need to be amazing on the first go, I can draft code and go back
              to it later. 
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3><em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em></h3>
          <p>Empathy and self-awareness are both part of our emotional intelligence, and stem from 
            understanding how we are feeling and how others are feeling. Empathising with other people 
            allows us to be able to relate to them and work better within a team.
            Self-awareness allows us to regulate our responses to our emotions. For example, if I’m aware 
            that I get anxious or stressed when I am trying to do too many things at once, I can keep an 
            eye on my environment for stress factors and on my physical state (whether I’m feeling tense 
            and hunching my shoulders) to reduce those stress factors before they become overwhelming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h3><em>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</em></h3>
          <p>That it is practical and can be applied to my own life.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h3><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</em></h3>
          <p>Overcoming my bias to things like meditation, which I felt was a bit of an airy-fairy idea 
            and would not be useful, only take up time (which I don’t have much of).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h3><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills
            learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em></h3>
          <p> think that businesses have identified that people in IT careers often don’t have interpersonal 
            skills and have let you know that they’re looking for graduates who do. You’ve also mentioned 
            that this course can be challenging in the amount we’re expected to learn, so having problem 
            solving skills and a learning plan in place will be good for us now and when we graduate.

          <h3><em>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></h3>
          <p>It doesn’t feel like a waste of time, because it has given me an insight into who I am and 
            what I need to work on going forward. However I have found it more challenging than coding 
            because it involves introspection and it isn’t always pleasant to question who you are. </p>
