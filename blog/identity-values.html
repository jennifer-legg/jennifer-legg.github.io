              Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision,

          <p class="long-text">
            I had to make an ethical decision in a previous job when I was asked
            to back-date signed documents. I was relatively green and I didn’t
            have enough experience to know whether back-dating was common
            practice, however I felt uncomfortable doing so because I value
            honesty and it felt fraudulent. My decision was to leave the job - I
            was not confident enough to address the practice with my employer.
          </p>
          <p class="long-text">
            Looking back on this now, I still feel I was right to be
            uncomfortable. Having worked further in the field, I know
            back-dating signed documents isn't normal. I do sometimes wonder if
            instead of leaving without saying anything, I could have talked to
            my employer and if that would have changed the way we worked.
            However I also acknowledge that there was a large power imbalance.
          </p>
          <p class="long-text">
            I hope that if I am asked to do something I’m not comfortable with,
            I will have the bravery and self-certainty to stand up for myself
            and ask questions. I would like to learn ways to say no when I’m not
            comfortable with a situation without being confrontational or
            escalating the situation.

            My upbringing influenced my value and identity. My parents believed
            that technology such as computers and television were bad for my
            siblings and I. We didn't watch tv or have a computer at home until
            I was 15.

            I hated it at the time as I felt different from my schoolmates, but
            it did mean that we spent more time making things. We were given
            off-cuts of wood and hammers/nails/clamps/wood glue and we made a
            wooden toy castle that we painted. We painted and we drew. I enjoyed
            and still enjoy creating things. This is what I’m looking forward to
            most about this course - that we can use code to make something new.

            <strong>I am prudent:</strong> I think through what I’m about to do
            before doing it.

          <p>
            <strong>I am used to high pressure environments:</strong> I have
            learned to deal with stress so that it doesn’t make me rush my work
            and make stupid mistakes. I have developed methods of managing
            workloads, for example by looking through a project to see what time
            it is expected to take and setting daily goals about what I need to
            complete by when.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I am loyal and kind, and a good teamplayer:</strong> I like
            supporting and working with other people. I get satisfaction from
            helping others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I value justice and honesty:</strong> I am honest about what
            work I feel I can complete and I try to divide the workload fairly
            when working in a team.

            I struggle to say no and to stand up for myself and my ideas. This
            means that I often take on too much work and struggle rather than
            admitting that I have reached my limit. I also procrastinate and put
            off starting tasks that I feel are hard or insurmountable.

            I was working with three people on a project where none of us knew
            each other. It was a school project and there were different levels
            of motivation. One of the team members didn't hold up their portion
            of the work. At the time, I didn't address the issue. The two of us
            who were motivated split the other person's work between us. It
            meant that the two of us had a lot more to do.

            If I was in that situation now, I would address the problem with the
            person who wasn't contributing. If they didn't step up, I would
            assess what this meant for our group (if it would affect our ability
            to hand in the project on time) and report it to whoever was
            overseeing the project.
