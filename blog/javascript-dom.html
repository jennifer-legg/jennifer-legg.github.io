          <h1>Technical blog - JS Fundamentals</h1>
          <h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript and the DOM - a super condensed summary</h2>
          <p>
            HTML, CSS and javascript are all used on a website for different
            purposes. HTML creates the content (what text, headings, images and
            links should be on the page) and CSS controls the layout and design.
            Javascript manipulates the website, changing the HTML on the page as
            you interact with it. Javascript is able to do so because of the
            document object model (DOM). The DOM changes all HTML elements into
            objects, which have functions and properties that javascript can
            access to use to manipulate what is on the webpage. We can see
            behind the scenes and look at what the DOM is doing (and change it
            ourselves in real time!) with browser developer tools.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h2>ClickyButton!</h2>
          <img
            class="small-img"
            src="../images/clicky-button-HTML.png"
            alt="HTML code for clickyButton"
          />
          <p>
            This html code is for the button below. As you can see, the white
            code is what the button element says on it (Click).
            <br />
            The writing after the green id= (clickyButton) is a unique name for
            this button. No other buttons or any other items on this website are
            called clickyButton. <br />
            The code after the class= (black-button) is to make the button look
            nice with CSS. Many buttons or other items can have the same class
            and look like black-button.
          </p>
          <img
            class="small-img"
            src="../images/css-black-button.png"
            alt="CSS black-button class"
          />
          <p>
            This is the CSS which decides how the button looks. It sets the
            button to have a black background and blue foreground (blue text).
          </p>
          <p class="stay-below">
            Now lets look at Javascript, so that the button will do something!
            When your browser loads the webpage, the whole page is turned into a
            document object model so that javascript can interact with the HTML
            and change things. We can use javascript with clickyButtonâ€™s id to
            find clickyButton in the document object. The DOM provides us with a
            document <a href="#explain-function">function</a> named
            getElementById which we can use for this. We only want the button to
            do something if we click on it. We can use the onclick() function
            for this.
          </p>
          <img
            class="full-width-img"
            src="../images/calling-the-doThisFunction.png"
            alt="code to call the doThisFunction() when clickyButton clicks"
          />
          <p>
            Now when we click the button, clickyButton will call and run the
            doThisFunction(). Read all about the doThisFunction below, then
            decide whether you want to click it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="centered-box">
          <button id="clickyButton" class="black-button">
            I'm a clickyButton! Should you click me?
          </button>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h2>doThisFunction(buttonId)</h2>
          <img
            class="full-width-img"
            src="../images/javascript-doThisFunction.png"
            alt="code for doThisFunction()"
          />
          <p>
            This is the code for doThisFunction(buttonId). To work, it needs an
            argument of a String of the id for the button. It also needs a
            globally declared audio Object with the name scaryAudio. The code
            sets out that innerHTML will replace the text on the button.
            Computers read code from the top down, calling each function as they
            go, then action it, unless this is changed by conditionals or loops.
            This is called
            <a href="#controlFlow">control flow</a>. Therefore in the
            doThisFunction, we will never see that the button says "Hello, this
            is a pretty flower!" because the computer immediately rewrites the
            text with "Stand by for world annihilation..." before we can see it.
            Sooooo... do you think you should press the button?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border stay-below" id="explain-function">
          <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p>
            Functions are (mostly) self-contained code that do one thing. They
            can take in information through the argument (the brackets after the
            name of the function), and can return information to the rest of the
            code. They can also access global variables (variables declared
            outside of functions). Functions are useful because they simplify
            code by decreasing repetition. For example, I could use this
            function with different buttons so that they all do the same thing.
            As functions are mostly self contained, they can help you narrow
            down where any problems are.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border" id="controlFlow">
          <h2>Control flow, conditionals and loops</h2>
          <p>
            <img
              class="small-img"
              src="../images/if-statement.png"
              alt="if/else statement example"
            />
            When a computer reads a piece of code, it starts at the top of the
            document and works its way down, line by line, to the bottom,
            <strong>except</strong> when we change the order by putting
            functions or loops or conditionals. When a function is called, the
            computer will down the document to that function and read it, line
            by line, then go back up to where it was before. We can tell the
            computer to skip bits of code with conditionals such as 'if/else'
            statements. Conditionals are options for the computer based on what
            is true or false. This morning, I told my daughter that if she put
            on her clothes, I'd let her watch TV. If not, she would go straight
            to breakfast in her pjs without watching TV . She put on her
            clothes, at which point the if statement was true and we watched TV.
            The 'else' was skipped because the 'if' was true.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="small-img"
              src="../images/for-loop.png"
              alt="for loop example"
            />
            Loops also control the flow of a computer reading code. They tell a
            computer to do one particular thing over and over again until it has
            completed that thing a designated amount of times. Compare it to the
            why game. My daughter loves the why game. When she starts the game
            (on initilization) my daughter is not bored. Her boredom level is at
            0. She will get generally get bored after about 5 repetitions. So
            while her boredom level is at less than 5, she will keep
            looping/playing. Every time she asks 'why' she gets one level more
            bored with the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            For loops are extremely useful in accessing all of the information
            in arrays, because the items in an array are accessed by their index
            number.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
          <p>
            Arrays and Objects are both types of variables. They're both used to
            store sets of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays are a bit like a shopping list or a to-do list Each piece of
            data in the array has an index number, like the numbers on a list.
            This numbering starts at 0 instead of 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Objects store data in key/value pairs. For example, for an object
            called painting, a key could be 'artist' and the value 'Picasso'.
            Objects don't have an index, therefore we can't use a for loop to
            access information as we do an array. We need to use a for... in
            loop instead. Object keys are always a String, however their pairs
            can be another type of data such as number/array/or an object.
