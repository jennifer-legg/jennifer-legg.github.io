        <h1>Technical blog - JS Fundamentals</h1>
        <h2>HTML, CSS, Javascript and the DOM - a super condensed summary</h2>
        <div>
          HTML, CSS and javascript are all used on a website for different
          purposes. HTML creates the content (what text, headings, images and
          links should be on the page) and CSS controls the layout and design.
          Javascript manipulates the website, changing the HTML on the page as
          you interact with it. Javascript is able to do so because of the
          document object model (DOM). The DOM changes all HTML elements into
          objects, which have functions and properties that javascript can
          access to use to manipulate what is on the webpage. We can see behind
          the scenes and look at what the DOM is doing (and change it ourselves
          in real time!) with browser developer tools.
        </div>
        <h2>ClickyButton!</h2>

        <div>
          <img
            class="small-img"
            src="../images/clicky-button-HTML.png"
            alt="HTML code for clickyButton"
          />
          This html code is for the button below. As you can see, the white code
          is what the button element says on it (Click).
          <br />
          The writing after the green id= (clickyButton) is a unique name for
          this button. No other buttons or any other items on this website are
          called clickyButton. <br />
          The code after the class= (black-button) is used to make the button
          good with CSS. Many buttons or other items can have the same class and
          look like black-button.
        </div>

        <div class="stay-below">
          <img
            class="small-img"
            src="../images/CSS-black-button.png"
            alt="CSS black-button class"
          />
          This is the CSS which decides how the button looks. It sets the button
          to have a black background and blue foreground (blue text).
        </div>

        <div class="stay-below">
          Now lets look at Javascript, so that the button will do something!
          When your browser loads the webpage, the whole page is turned into a
          document object model so that javascript can interact with the HTML
          and change things. We can use javascript with clickyButton’s id to
          find clickyButton in the document object. The DOM provides us with a
          document
          <a href="#explain-function">function</a> named getElementById which we
          can use for this.
          <span>document.getElementById(“clickyButton”)</span>
        </div>
        <div class="stay-below">
          We only want the button to do something if we click on it and we can
          to use the onclick() function for this
          <span
            >document.getElementById('clickyButton').onclick = (e) =>
            doThisFunction('clickyButton')</span
          >
          Now when we click the button, clickyButton will call and run the
          doThisFunction(). Read all about the doThisFunction below, then decide
          whether you want to click it.
        </div>
        <div class="centered-box">
          <button id="clickyButton" class="black-button">
            Click here to see what happens
          </button>
        </div>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <div id="explain-function">
          Below is the doThisFunction. Functions are (mostly) self-contained.
          They are useful because they can simplify code. The same function can
          be called (used) multiple times. For example, I could use this
          function with different buttons so that they all do the same thing.
          You can send information into a function through the argument () and
          you can return information.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script>
      const scaryAudio = new Audio('../audio/alarm-audio.mp3')

      document.getElementById('clickyButton').onclick = (e) =>
        annihilate('clickyButton')

      function annihilate(button) {
        document.getElementById(button).innerHTML =
          'Stand by for world annihilation... loading...'
        document
          .getElementById(button)
          .classList.replace('black-button', 'danger-button')
        alert(
          'WHY DID YOU CLICK IT! SOMEONE ALWAYS HAS TO BE THE SMART ASS AND CLICK THE BUTTON'
        )
        scaryAudio.loop = true
        scaryAudio.play()
      }
