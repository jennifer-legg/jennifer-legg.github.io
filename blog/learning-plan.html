          <p>
            I would like to work in web development (front end or backend). I’d
            like to learn testing too, to broaden the variety of jobs that I can
            apply for.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="dark-border">
          <h3>
            <em
              >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning:</em
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths are that I am persistent, detail-orientated and prudent.
            When I am focused on something, I can give it my full attention. I can
            work through code part by part so that I understand what is happening.
            I am cautious and will take my time to think through a problem rather
            than just rushing in. However, a limitation to these traits is that I
            can get bogged down in the details. I’ve found that following
            time-boxing guidelines can help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another of my limitations is that if I’m unsure of where to start, or
            if I am daunted or feel overwhelmed by a project, I procrastinate. I
            am trying to learn to face my fear by breaking down a bigger problem
            into manageable and less daunting parts, or giving myself a very
            limited time for procrastinating (e.g. I can do this activity until x
            time then I will study).

          <p>
            I would like to learn to be braver. I don’t have a lot of confidence
            in myself. It can be hard for me to contribute to a team. I’m nervous
            about all of the group work that we’re going to do this year but I’m
            hoping that it’ll be an opportunity to not just take a back seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do like the theory that confidence is grown rather than intrinsic -
            I hope that if I build coding skills through enough practice, I will
            be confident in the knowledge that I’ve gained which will help me to
            speak out and contribute more.

          <ul>
            <li>I will make time for any video calls or team meetings.</li>
            <li>
              Before starting each sprint, I will look through the time boxing for
              each module and try to split it into goals for each week, then each
              day, so that I keep on top of the workload.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will make sure that any team work is planned and divided fairly
              between the team members. Assigning twice the expected time to each
              task would assist when we’re doing our own timeboxing.

            <em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
              you:</em>
            <ul>
              <li>It will be important for me to talk to someone before my emotions build up. 
                I have a supportive family and a husband who is a tester so understands that programming can be frustrating. 
              </li>
              <li>I will find a way to burn off steam - take a break, do something physical.</li>
              <li>I will plan each week so that I’m slightly ahead at each stage. Not racing ahead, 
                just finishing with a couple of days spare - for exam ple, finishing the sprint on Friday, not on Sunday. 
                This is because there are variables that I can’t control, such as my daughter being sick and needing to be home, 
                when I would usually use her kindergarten time to study.</li>

            If I’m stuck with a problem that I haven’t been able to solve myself, I will ask in the help-desk discord chat, 
            or ask other students or a facilitator. I have already asked for assistance from the help-desk chat, which was answered 
            promptly. <br>
            I’m aware that work is due 10pm on a Sunday and that if I need an extension, I need to talk to my facilitator and have
            this sorted before midday on the Friday before the due date.

          <p>
            I expect the facilitator team to assist with problems I and other students come across, 
            and that they provide explanations for any assistance with code so that I can learn, not just correct the code. 
            I expect the facilitation team to be fair/just if we need extensions and ask within the required timing. 
            I expect the team to be kind and not judge us when we ask questions.

            My daughter is at home with me in the afternoons on weekdays while my husband works. I cannot do coursework from 12pm to 5/6pm Mon-Fri. <br>
            I also take her to dance classes on a Saturday morning between 8.30-10.30am. If there is no alternative, I can talk to my mother about taking her but that is hard to arrange.
