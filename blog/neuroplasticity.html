        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3><em>What is Neuroplasticity and how does understanding it benefit us?</em></h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the concept that our brains are constantly changing - 
          parts of our brains are making new neural connections as we learn throughout our lives.
          Learning doesn't stop at puberty, although our brains become less plastic. Instead, 
          we're changing our brains throughout our lives. 
          The changes can be both positive and negative. Just as we can make new connections by 
          practicing and learning new things, the current connections and knowledge that we don't use are pruned away. 
          Understanding neuroplasticity can help us to become informed learners, by using the its principles to our 
          benefit (see below). It is also motivating. We can realise that we're capable of change and learning, 
          no matter our age. 
        </p>
        <h3><em>How can I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?</em></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Practice as much as I can, to create new neural networks.</li>
          <li>Relate the new knowledge to things I know already, so that the chemical short term changes in my brain become long term physical changes. </li>
          <li>Reduce distractions, so that I can focus and pay attention to what I'm learning.</li>
          <li>Learn steadily (break learning into chunks, doing some each day), so that I'm more likely to retain what I'm learning.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><em>How can I increase my neuroplasticity?</em></h3>
        <p>I enjoyed a Ted talk by Lara Boyd which talks about neuroplasticity - 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNHBMFCzznE">"After watching this, your brain will not be the same"</a>.
          The talk is interesting because it says that the thing that changes our brain and increases our brain's plasticity 
          the most is our behaviour. To change my brain, I need to put myself out of my comfort zone and be open to new experiences.
          Practice is important, but as well as practicing, I need to increase the level of difficulty so that I'm constantly 
          challenging myself. 
        </p>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3><em>What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</em></h3>
        <p>
          When we realise that our brains are plastic and that our knowledge and ability to do things is not set at birth or limited 
          by a predetermined intelligence level, we can start to look at learning from a growth rather than fixed mindset. 
          A growth mindset increases our motivation because we understand that we are capable of learning. We stop looking at 
          something we can't do as a reflection on our lack of ability, but as a challenge to help us learn more. 
          I found it fascinating to learn that people who have a growth mindset are more likely to keep trying harder problems and 
          that people who have a fixed mindset are more likely to cheat, or to lie and say that they succeeded because they
          think failing is a reflection on them personally.
        </p>
        <h3><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></h3>
        <p>
          I'm going to start using different language with myself. If I have trouble solving a problem, I can tell myself that 
          trying new things helps me learn, and that it's ok to struggle because it's part of the learning
          process, rather than tell myself that I'm bad at this particular activity and if I were smarter I'd be able to do it.
          I'll praise myself for how much effort I put into something rather than an achievement. I will push myself to try 
          things at the edge of my comfort/learning zone, and if I make a mistake I can acknowledge it and move on, 
          because mistakes are a part of learning. I found this <a href="https://theeducationhub.org.nz/an-introduction-to-growth-mindset-2/">
          EducationHub introduction to growth mindset</a> had a practical breakdown of the growth mindset and how it can be helpful when learning.

        <h3>How will these concepts shape or influence my learning plan and strategy?</h3>
        <p>There are two main things that I want to influence my learning plan. Firstly, I feel that I'm not putting in enough 
          practice. This has been because I'm a little familiar with javascript already, so the katas haven't taken me long to 
          get through. I need to push myself outside my confort zone and look through the stretch material, to see where I 
          can learn more, and try to practice every day so that I can convert learning to long term memory. 
          Perhaps I can introduct more javascript to my webpage. Secondly, I need to be aware of the language
          I use with myself when it comes to learning so that I'm willing to take risks and make mistakes. I need to praise my effort 
          instead of focusing on what I'm achieving.
