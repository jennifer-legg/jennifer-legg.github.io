      <h3><em>Problem solving when blocked on a simple problem</em></h3>
      <p>
        I ran into a problem when I was trying to use a method new to me called "map" to go word
        by word through a sentence and change each word so it had a capital. I kept getting an 
        error message. I tried checking what type of data was in the variable by printing it out
        to the console, so that I could see it. I read through documentation which described what 
        the method does. I scanned through the code for any typos. Nothing. 
        I took a break and went for a walk to clear my head.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I came back the computer, I was calmer. I googled the error message and 
        discovered that the problem was that the map method I was using does not work on 
        sentences (Strings). I had to change the sentence to a list of words called an array 
        to use the map method.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt piqued, because I had searched for a good 15 minutes online to try and find the 
        right way to write the map method to use on the sentence and the search results had 
        only showed examples of how to use it on a array. 
        Turns out that was because it is never used with Strings, only with Arrays!
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt that it is important to check if the method you are trying to use can be used 
        with that variable type, and that googling error messages can help point you in the right
        direction. I also found that sometimes you just need a break to reset and see a problem
        from a fresh perspective.

      <h3><em>Elegantly solving a problem</em></h3>
      <p>
        I felt I solved a problem elegantly by first using psuedo code to map out what I needed to do, 
        then writing the code. Pseudo code isn't real code - it's a step of instructions that can 
        help you map out what the code should do, like a blueprint. The computer can't understand it
        but it helped me to think the problem through without worrying about the syntax (the exact way 
        the computer would need to see it).
        Once I'd written the code, I discovered that I could reduce the four lines to one line of code
        by changing the way it was written. But without the first draft and psuedo code, 
        I'd have been a bit lost. 
      </p>

      <h3><em>How confident do I feel with different problem solving methods?</em></h3>
      <p>
        After the last javascript excercise, I feel confident using pseudocode, trying something, talking to an 
        inanimate object or myself (the "rubber ducky" 
        method), reading error messages, console.logging, and googling error messages. <br>
        I'm not very confident in asking peers/coaches for help. Some of that is because I get a bit 
        embarrassed, and if I don't understand the response or I'd like to know something 
        further, I often will be reluctant to ask, because I feel like I should know what they meant. <br>
        I'm also building more confidence with improving my process with reflection but I find that 
        I still need prompts or questions to start the reflection process.

      <h3><em>What was a time that you were reluctant to ask for help? Why were you reluctant?</em></h3>
      <p>I have been struggling with importing libraries from the internet. I'm reluctant to ask for help 
        because I don't feel like I have the vocabulary to describe what I'm struggling with. I tried to ask in
        the homegroup meeting but I didn't feel like I'd asked the question right, and I became embarrassed at
        talking in a group when no-one else was asking for assistance. I'm now trying to learn a little more 
        about the process in general so that I can describe exactly what it is that I 
        don't understand. Perhaps by the time I understand the background, I won't need to ask for help anymore anyway!
